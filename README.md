# Project for Octowash

Using previous build as a basis. Keeping some of the code in and leaving it commented out depending on the clients needs or if they decide to increase functionality (Note: Client only specified a Home and Estimate application. Included are Services and contact).

DEV - NOTES:
Project was relatively easy. Firebase makes an efficent and easy backend to work with. Had minor issue with setting up an admin functionality, I'm currently using the spark plan even though I plan on upgrading. Since the site only uses login for editing, this should be sufficient. It was overall an enjoyable build. Building off of already established code has been fun and the frustration I felt when I first started coding as subsided. Even when I ran into a major issue here, it was a fun experience and hilariously the issue was something minor that had no impact on my code. If the client is happy with the overall website, I'll start to trim back the commented out features and unused code. Cool beans!
